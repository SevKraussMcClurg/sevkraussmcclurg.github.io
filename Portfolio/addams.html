                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><i>The Addams Family</i> was directed by Ian Duncan and Lisa Frystak at Eastside Preparatory School
                    in spring 2024.
                    For this show, I worked as the properties manager and assistant stage manager. As properties
                    manager, I facilitated the design and construction of a variety of props within the show, for
                    example, this apple to the right.</p>
                <p>This apple needed to break in half after getting 'shot' by an arrow onstage. I achieved this by
                    taking a fake styrofoam apple, cutting it in half, sealing the two sides with air dry clay, painting
                    them, and adding magnets. This allowed the apple to snap shut and stay shut during the scene until
                    an actor pulled it apart.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>There were a lot of challenges with this show, for example, a song where 12 actors each brought on a
                    prop that corresponded to a lyric from one side, crossed the stage, and exited on the other side, in quick succession. I had to both construct the props as the
                    properties manager and then figure out how they were going to get across the stage and be stored as
                    the assistant stage manager.</p>
                <p>The first part was solved through conversations with the directors and planning ahead for the amount
                    of work that it would take. The second part was harder due to the size of our theater and the
                    backstage space being very limited but with some careful organization, I was able to fit all these
                    props onto our tables backstage.</p>
